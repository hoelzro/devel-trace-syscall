- import with no arguments - trap all system calls?
- open/close
- mmap/sbrk? (memory allocations)
- system call happening in a destructor
- What about system calls that happen at compile time? (opening of modules, for one)
- Test system calls other than open
- Mess up the file handles to test error handling
- make sure read doesn't report its own reads
- Overflow
- BEGIN time events
- Exception events
- Exit code of the program
- What about exec
